Started this repository thinking that I absolutely need to start building something where I can recommend the right wallets to use for Bitcoin (BTC) and Lightning Network sats (LN-sats).<br>
<br>
[BlueWallet](https://github.com/bluewallet/) is by far my favorite Bitcoin wallet, and Lightning wallet.<br>
| Pros: |
| --- |
| - Lightning wallets are completely separate from the Bitcoin wallets |
| - Security with [Plausible Deniability](https://bluewallet.io/features/#pdenial) |
